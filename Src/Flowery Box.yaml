notes: |
  Depicted elements unclear.  The inner flower resembles
  [[http://www.baronet4tibet.com/symbolism.html|a
  four-petaled flower used to represent the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism]].
  (Thanks,
  Cynwrig!) An alternate depiction from the Sasaki copy of Kenmon Shokamon,
  [[Mon:Sasaki Flowery Box]],
  depicts both flowers with the standard flower square/rhombus depiction.
