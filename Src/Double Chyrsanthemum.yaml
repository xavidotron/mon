notes: 'This is one of the few mon with restricted usage in period; it was the mon
  of the Emperor, and was only used as he commanded.  Other similar mon are presumptuous
  for SCA use, as they imply imperial connections: for example, the back of a 14-petaled
  chrysanthemum was used by imperial princes, and Emperor Go Daigo used a 17-petaled
  version when exiled.<<SamuraiHeraldry 6/>>  Mon combining the chrysanthemum with
  other elements are more reasonable, signifying loyalty to the Emperor rather than
  a connection to him.<<SamuraiHeraldry 57/>>'
