  瀕!形

translation: Sandbank Form
notes: |
  Kanji and transliteration from Kenmon Shokamon. The kanji description
  there neglects the mountain (山; "yama") kanji characters below the
  suhama, a reference to the second kanji in the Suyama family name.

  The use of a suhama may also be a pun on the Suyama name.
